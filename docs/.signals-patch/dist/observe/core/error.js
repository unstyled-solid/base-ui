/**
 * Thrown by a tracked read whose value is currently pending (an async memo /
 * `createSignal(asyncFn)` / projection / store derivation that hasn't settled
 * yet). Surfacing through the reactive graph is what suspends the consumer
 * scope — the nearest enclosing `<Loading>` boundary catches the throw and
 * renders its fallback until the source resolves.
 *
 * App code rarely catches this directly; `<Loading>` is the canonical
 * handler. The error type is exposed for advanced cases — e.g. interop layers
 * that bridge Solid's pending-throw protocol to a different async strategy,
 * or tests that want to assert on the suspension shape.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Advanced: distinguish "not ready yet" from a real error in custom
 * // boundary plumbing. App code should rely on `<Loading>` / `<Errored>`.
 * try {
 *   const value = readReactiveSource();
 * } catch (err) {
 *   if (err instanceof NotReadyError) throw err; // re-throw to suspend
 *   reportError(err);
 * }
 * ```
